Reporting and Analytics Dashboard Project for INST 326 Object-Oriented Programming



## 🏗️ Introduction 
This project focuses on building a **Library/Information Center Management Dashboard** that provides **reporting and analytics tools** to help library staff, administrators, and stakeholders manage operations more efficiently.  

The system is designed to solve key challenges in the library domain—such as tracking resource usage, generating accurate reports, and understanding user engagement—by offering **automated data visualization and insights**.

## 💡 Problem Statement  
Modern libraries and information centers face several operational challenges:  

- ❌ **Inefficient resource tracking** – Difficult to monitor usage across books, e-resources, and facilities.  
- 🧾 **Manual and error-prone reporting** – Time-consuming spreadsheet-based workflows.  
- 📉 **Unclear user engagement** – Limited insight into who uses library services and how.  
- 💰 **Uninformed financial decisions** – Lack of supporting data for budgeting and demonstrating impact.  

These issues reduce efficiency, limit service quality, and make it hard to justify funding.  

Our dashboard provides **automated reporting**, **real-time analytics**, and **actionable insights**—empowering decision-makers to optimize operations and showcase the library’s value.
